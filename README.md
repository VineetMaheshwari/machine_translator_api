# Machine Translator API

Here I have built a machine trasnlator API which uses MBART model for translation from hugging face built by facebook(https://huggingface.co/facebook/mbart-large-50-many-to-many-mmt). Then I built a built an API of this model using Flask in Python. Then for deploying the API I have dockerized the application and then run the application using Docker containers on the server. Image of the Docker can be found here (https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vineet20020/machine_translation_service)
